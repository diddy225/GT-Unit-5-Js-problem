Part 1: Redesign UI for Employee List

For the main part of this week's homework, you're going to be polishing up last week's assignment with a cleaner UI and cleaner code.

There are two parts to this week's redo. They are as follows:


Match the new design

Match the designs to look like the following images:





You will need to use Font Awesome for the icons.


Clean up the code


Replace all for loops with forEach, map, filter, find, some, every, findIndex, or includes

Use a switch statement for the primary logic
All rendering takes place in a render function
No global variables other than functions and state (so command and employeeList should be on state).
